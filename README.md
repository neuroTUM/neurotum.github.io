## Local Development

First download bun. Bun will serve as your runtime and package/task manager. You may use other package managers
during local development, but make sure to use bun when adding any dependencies to keep the lock-file up to date.

To run the dev server:

```sh
bun dev
```

To format the codebase:

```sh
bun format
```

To lint the codebase:

```sh
bun lint
```
