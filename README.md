## Local Development

First download [`deno`](https://deno.com/). Deno will serve as your runtime and package/task manager. You may use other package managers
during local development, but make sure to use deno when adding any dependencies to keep the lock-file up to date.

To run the dev server:

```sh
deno run dev
```

To format the codebase:

```sh
deno run format
```

To lint the codebase:

```sh
deno run lint
```
